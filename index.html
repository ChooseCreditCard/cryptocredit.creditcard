    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is “Crypto Credit” in a Card Context?</h2>
      <p>“Crypto credit” usually refers to a credit line that is secured by digital assets instead of traditional collateral. The user deposits crypto with a platform, which assigns a borrowing limit based on the value of that collateral.</p>
      <p>In some product designs, this credit line is connected to a payment card, so card spending is effectively financed against the crypto position rather than an unsecured revolving line in the usual sense.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>Core Building Blocks of Crypto-Backed Credit</h2>
      <p>Although implementations vary, many crypto-backed credit products share the same structural components:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Collateral deposit</strong> – you transfer supported tokens or coins to the provider or smart contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Loan-to-value (LTV)</strong> – the maximum borrowing amount is a fraction of the collateral’s value.</li>
        <li><strong>Margin thresholds</strong> – specific LTV levels may trigger warnings, margin calls or liquidations.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest and fees</strong> – borrowing rates, origination fees and card-related fees are defined in schedules.</li>
        <li><strong>Repayment rules</strong> – how and when outstanding balances must be repaid to restore collateral headroom.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When a card is attached, card transactions draw from the credit line, and repayments reduce that card-linked balance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Liquidations, Volatility and Collateral Management</h2>
      <p>Because crypto prices can move quickly, platforms rely on automated rules to keep credit lines collateralized:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Price feeds or oracles track the value of the collateral in near real time.</li>
        <li>If market moves push LTV above a threshold, the platform may require extra collateral or partial repayment.</li>
        <li>If no action is taken, some or all collateral can be sold to cover the outstanding balance and fees.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These mechanisms are described in platform documentation and can differ substantially between providers and jurisdictions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>How Crypto Credit Interacts With Card Usage</h2>
      <p>When a card is used on top of a crypto-backed line, several flows come together:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Card transactions are authorized and settled through normal payment networks.</li>
        <li>The resulting debits increase the borrowed amount on the crypto credit line.</li>
        <li>Interest accrues on that borrowed amount, according to the specific pricing tables.</li>
        <li>Repayments, either in fiat or crypto, reduce the outstanding credit and may free up collateral.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In some setups, rewards or incentives may also be paid in tokens, which adds another layer of volatility and risk.</p>
